      All this is is some animation stuffs. I didn't make the code, but basically it defines a gradient thats 30x as large as the screen size, and then has the gradient move from the left to the right for 2 seconds, stop, and then back for 2 seconds and it loops this forever. Removing the animation just makes the background a solid red.

         Other than that, this uses divs, which are basically smaller versions of the body class that you can use and stack inside of eachother, which is really useful for building a good looking website. Lastly, theres the rounded corners and the drop shadow. Drop shadow uses a filter property, and then you call the drop shadow, and the rounded corners you get from the Border Radius proprety.
